# Prediction-of-UIUC-Propeller-Efficiency-using-Decision-Tree-Regression-
This project focuses on developing a regression model to predict the efficiency of propellers based on the UIUC Propeller Database. The objective is to accurately estimate propeller performance, aiding in the design and optimization of propeller-driven aircraft.

Objective: To build a regression model for predicting the efficiency of propellers using data from the UIUC Propeller Database.            
Dataset: [The UIUC Propeller Database, which includes various parameters such as propeller dimensions, airspeed, RPM, and more, used for training and testing the model](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heitornunes/uiuc-propeller-database).
